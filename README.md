# satellite_finder


Project Title
This is the first draft of an app that will be part of a Django Website, but currently is just standalone. The script currently only uses Javascript and bootstrap, no jquery currenly. Click a location on the map and get a list of Satellites within a 10 degree range above. 0 degrees being directly above and 180 degrees spanning the horizontal horizon. The range is limited to 10 degrees and gives a rough ground level radius of approximately 1500km range based on highest altitude satellite being at a 10 Degree angle from vertical.
